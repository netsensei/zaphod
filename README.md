# Zaphod

This is a basic [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)/[HTML](https://abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers) boilerplate project. I use it as my own sandbox abling me to develop my personal frontend workflow.

## Why did you build this?

This project showecases a styled HTML page. It's not about the page itself though, it's about how I got there.

Styling a basic HTML page wasn't always this involved. I wanted to learn what it takes to style a basic HTML page with modern techniques. There are many best practices, tools and tutorials out there, but it's hard to glue all the pieces together in a sensible, maintainable whole. This project tries to document a somewhat sane frontend workflow.

There are many boilerplate projects, but this one is mine.
